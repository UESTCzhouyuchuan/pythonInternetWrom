Good morning. An olive branch in Afghanistan, faded hopes in Turkey and a New Zealand minister’s bike ride to child birth. Here’s what you need to know:

• A cease-fire offer in Afghanistan.

President Ashraf Ghani extended a trust-building measure to the Taliban before the Muslim holiday Eid al-Adha this week. He said the conditional cease-fire would start today and extend “until Nov. 21, birthday of the Prophet Muhammad.”

There was no immediate response from the Taliban, which has staged a charm offensive of sorts in advance of the Islamic holiday — even as the insurgents, in the past week alone, have overrun cities, burned down government facilities and killed hundreds of their opponents. Above, a checkpoint on the Ghazni-Kabul highway last week.

The U.N., meanwhile, urged all sides of the Afghan conflict to protect aid workers delivering critical assistance to a population suffering the brunt of war and drought.

And Rod Nordland, a Times correspondent who has been reporting on the country since the 1979 Soviet invasion, writes that there are two wars convulsing Afghanistan: “the war of blood and guts, and the war of truth and lies.”

• President Trump attacks The Times.

Mr. Trump, in a series of tweets, denounced a Times report describing the extensive cooperation between the White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, and investigators for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.

The president confirmed that he allowed Mr. McGahn, above center, and other officials to cooperate fully with the inquiry, saying he had “nothing to hide.” But Mr. Trump said the Times’s article had falsely insinuated that Mr. McGahn had “turned” on him.

In a statement, The Times said the paper stood by the report and the reporters who wrote it, Michael S. Schmidt and Maggie Haberman. In one of his tweets, Mr. Trump called them “two Fake reporters.”

• Faded hope in Turkey.

President Recep Tayyip Erdogan once held promise as a potential beacon of democracy for a region rife with religious conflict.

After all, Turkey was a stalwart NATO ally and sought to join the European Union, while Mr. Erdogan presented himself as a moderate and modernizing Muslim leader for the post-9/11 age.

But as he began amassing supreme powers, this analysis points out, the notion that he was a liberalizing force has been extinguished.

• A nation divided, and in debt.

Imran Khan, the former cricket star turned politician, was sworn in as Pakistan’s prime minister on Saturday, with many wondering whether his campaign rhetoric will match the policies he pursues.

As our South Asia correspondents explain, Mr. Khan’s populist campaign promises “will bump up against the reality that Pakistan’s government has little money to spare, is straddled with debt and must tighten its finances.”

If Mr. Khan completes his five-year term, he would be the first prime minister in Pakistan’s history to do so.

• “Beautiful Sunday morning for a bike ride.”

Julie Anne Genter, New Zealand’s minister for women and associate minister for health and transport, rode her bike “mostly downhill” to have her labor induced at Auckland City Hospital.

Ms. Genter, 38, is expected to become the second New Zealand government minister to deliver a baby this year, after Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern.

Business

• Elon Musk explains: In a sometimes tearful interview with The Times, he shared his struggles in trying to make Tesla’s production goals, saying, “This past year has been the most difficult and painful year of my career. It was excruciating.”

• Headlines to watch this week: The U.S. trade representative begins six days of hearings today on plans to place tariffs on another $200 billion of Chinese goods, and trade talks with China resume on Wednesday.

• “Crazy Rich Asians” took in $25.2 million at North American theaters over the weekend, easily enough for No. 1. “The Meg” placed second, collecting $21.2 million, for a two-week global total of roughly $300 million, including more than $100 million in China.

• Here’s a snapshot of global markets.
