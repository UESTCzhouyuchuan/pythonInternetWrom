About Multiprocess
====================

``multiprocess`` is a fork of ``multiprocessing``, and is developed as part of ``pathos``: 
https://github.com/uqfoundation/pathos

``multiprocessing`` is a package for the Python language which supports the
spawning of processes using the API of the standard library's
``threading`` module. ``multiprocessing`` has been distributed in the standard
library since python 2.6.

Features:

    - Objects can be transferred between processes using pipes or multi-producer/multi-consumer queues.
    - Objects can be shared between processes using a server process or (for simple data) shared memory.
    - Equivalents of all the synchronization primitives in ``threading`` are available.
    - A ``Pool`` class makes it easy to submit tasks to a pool of worker processes.


``multiprocess`` is part of ``pathos``,  a python framework for heterogeneous computing.
``multiprocess`` is in active development, so any user feedback, bug reports, comments,
or suggestions are highly appreciated.  A list of issues is located at https://github.com/uqfoundation/multiprocess/issues, with a legacy list maintained at https://uqfoundation.github.io/pathos-issues.html.

NOTE: A C compiler is required to build the included extension module. For python 3.3 and above, a C compiler is suggested, but not required.


Major Changes
==============

    - enhanced serialization, using ``dill``


Current Release
===============

This documentation is for version ``multiprocess-0.70.11.1`` (a fork of ``multiprocessing-0.70a1``).

The latest released version of ``multiprocess`` is available from::

    https://pypi.org/project/multiprocess

``Multiprocessing`` is distributed under a BSD license.


Development Version
===================

You can get the latest development version with all the shiny new features at::

    https://github.com/uqfoundation

If you have a new contribution, please submit a pull request.


Installation
============

``multiprocess`` is packaged to install from source, so you must
download the tarball, unzip, and run the installer::

    [download]
    $ tar -xvzf multiprocess-0.70.11.1.tgz
    $ cd multiprocess-0.70.11.1
    $ python setup.py build
    $ python setup.py install

You will be warned of any missing dependencies and/or settings
after you run the "build" step above.

Alternately, ``multiprocess`` can be installed with ``pip`` or ``easy_install``::

    $ pip install multiprocess

NOTE: A C compiler is required to build the included extension module from source. For python 3.3 and above, a C compiler is suggested, but not required. Binary installs do not require a C compiler.


Requirements
============

``multiprocess`` requires::

    - ``python``, **version == 2.7** or **version >= 3.5**
    - ``dill``, **version >= 0.3.3**

Optional requirements::

    - ``setuptools``, **version >= 0.6**


More Information
================

Probably the best way to get started is to look at the documentation at
http://multiprocess.rtfd.io. See ``multiprocess.examples`` for a set of example
scripts. You can also run the test suite with ``python -m multiprocess.tests``.
Please feel free to submit a ticket on github, or ask a question on
stackoverflow (**@Mike McKerns**).  If you would like to share how you use
``multiprocess`` in your work, please post send an email
(to **mmckerns at uqfoundation dot org**).
